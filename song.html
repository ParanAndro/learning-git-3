			<h1><span>Survivalism</span></h1>
			<h4>NINE INCH NAILS</h4>
			<div>I should have listened to her
				I should have listened to her
				So hard to keep control
				We kept on eating but
				Our bloated belly's still not full
				She gave us all she had but
				We went and took some more
				Can't seem to shut her legs
				Our mother nature is a whore
				I got my propaganda
				I got revisionism
				I got my violence
				In hi-def ultra-realism
				All a part of this great nation
				I got my fist
				I got my plan
				I got survivalism
			</div>
			<div>Hypnotic sound of sirens
				Echoing through the street

				The cocking of the rifles
				The marching of the feet
				You see your world on fire
				Don't try to act surprised
				We did just what you told us
				Lost our faith along the way and found ourselves believing your lies

				I got my propaganda
				I got revisionism
				I got my violence
				In hi-def ultra-realism
				All a part of this great nation
				I got my fist
				I got my plan
				I got survivalism
			</div>
